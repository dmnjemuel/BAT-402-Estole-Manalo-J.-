## Introduction 
Out of the 109 million people that live there, 57 million (52% of the
population) do not have access to a dependable supply of water that
is securely managed, and 43 million (39%) do not have access to
home sanitary facilities that are safely managed. Despite its
increasing economy, the Philippines confronts substantial water and
sanitation access difficulties. The country is quickly urbanizing, and
its expanding cities are struggling to provide appropriate water and
sanitation facilities to new citizens.
